# Orion Spaceship
The Orion Spaceship is a modular spaceship control system 
designed for simulation, prototyping, and educational purposes. 
The system abstracts the essential subsystems of a starship‚Äîsuch
as propulsion, life support, power management, environmental
controls, crew support, and more‚Äîinto independent, 
testable modules with clear interfaces. 
This design enables easy extension, simulation, 
and integration of custom or futuristic spaceship technologies, 
making it ideal for space simulation games, research projects,
or serious prototyping of advanced vehicle controls.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Install

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/honunu/orion-spaceship.git
cd orion-spaceship
```

(If you intend to use as a package, set up your environment and install dependencies as needed.)

### 2. Explore the Modules

Each subsystem is defined as an abstract class in `orion-spaceship/interfaces.py`. Example modules include:

- `CommandNavigation`
- `PropulsionDrive`
- `PowerSystem`
- `LifeSupport`
- `EnvironmentalControl`
- `CrewSupport`
- `SensorSuite`
- `SecuritySafety`
- `PayloadBay`
- `MaintenanceDiagnostics`


### 3. Compose Your Starship

Aggregate your modules into a main controller (e.g., `Starship`) that coordinates between systems and provides a unified status dashboard.

## üåå Example Use Cases

- **Space Simulation Games**: Realistic or imaginative starship controls
- **Research Prototyping**: Model and test advanced vehicle control systems
- **STEM Education**: Teach modular software architecture in a fun setting
- **AI/Automation**: Develop and test AI ‚Äúcrew‚Äù agents

## ü§ñ Extending Orion-Spaceship

1. **Add Your Own Module**: Create a new class inheriting from any abstract interface in `interfaces.py`.
2. **Override Methods**: Implement the required methods to bring your subsystem to life.
3. **Plug Into Your Ship**: Compose your `Starship` object by assigning your custom modules.
